                            <p>I have been using computers for pretty much my entire life. I built my own gaming computer when I was 13 and since then I have maintained and upgraded it. The majority of my experience has been using Windows but I do have some experience using both Mac and Linux.</p>

                            <p>Gaming has been a hobby of mine for the majority of my life. I have played a variety of games on a variety of systems. I have mainly played on PC since I built my computer.</p>

                            <h2>Coding</h2>
                            <p>Before I went to university I had very little experience coding. In my first year of university I did Java, HTML, CSS and Java script. I have always been a problem solver which is a good skillset to have when coding as it aids me when coming up with ways to do things that may not be obvious at first.</p>
